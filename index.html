              Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is characterised as an autoimmune inflammatory chronic disease of the central nervous system. Due to the degenerative character of MS, it can lead to disabilities over time. 
              The disease has no definitive cure, but its progression can be controlled by the use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Caring for patients living with MS involves addressing and identifying psychological, 
              social, and physical issues that might arise from the condition or be aggravated by it.

              The appropriate use of evidence-based research supports and optimise outcomes 
              in dealing with patients diagnosed with complex and multifaceted diseases, such as MS. Philosophical, theoretical, practical, and regulatory 
              frameworks systematically organise and indicate theories based on relevant concepts in nursing practice (Hammer et al., 2019). 
              Concept defines the knowledge underlying practice, and theories are based upon the interpretation of concepts (Hammer et al., 2019). Frameworks 
              work as bridges between research and practice, aiding the evidence-based and holistic approach adopted by registered nurses caring for patients living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), their families and communities.

                Registered nurses play a pivotal role in assisting and coordinating the care of patients living with MS (Multiple Sclerosis Nurses Australasia Inc (MSNA), 2016). Nurses are often required to use skills developed across individual 
                and professional levels, such as emotional resilience, psychological and communication skills, as well as clinical knowledge (Samara et al., 2022).

            <p>Sage is 28 years old and was diagnosed with MS three weeks ago (22 February 2023). Initially, about eight months ago, Sage started experiencing tiredness, muscle weakness and tremors (specially when lifting light weight objects), occasional blurred vision and short-term memory problems. The symptoms occurred infrequently, which caused Sage to not seek help for some time. However, Sage experienced an exacerbation that  resulted in paralysis of her right arm and partial paralysis of her left arm. After relevant assessments to discard other possibilities and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, Sage receives her diagnostic from the medical team and also intravenous treatment (steroids). She was referred to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital for treatment of the paralysis. Upon discharge, Sage was able to hold a glass with her hands but still unable to lift it.  
              Sage is still dealing with the fact that she was diagnosed with MS and all the implications of this diagnose to her life. She lives with her mother and sister, who are also affected by the recent events but willing to support her.
              Sage is very confused with all the medical terms she suddenly have to become familiar with, and is unsure about what the next steps are regarding her treatment. She is worried about not being able to lift her arms again, and comes to you for advice.

            Due to the complexity of the disease, MS nursing involves many aspects to consider and 
            reconsider over time depending on patient’s needs, changing conditions, responses and treatment options. 
            The registered nurse will be in a better position to assist S
            age by making use of some underlying principles regarding MS, 
            as discussed by Halper (2012) and summarised on table 1:

          <p class="p-4">
            In addition, MS nursing can be organised as domains of practice, 
            which consist of areas of nursing practice where nurses are responsible when assisting a patient with 
            MS and their support network. The domains of practice are also discussed in Burke et al. (2011), Halper (2012), 
            and at the Professional and Practice Standards for Multiple Sclerosis Nurses organised by Multiple Sclerosis Nurses 
            Australasia Inc (MSNA)(2016). 
            They are summarised in Figure 1.
