                The term ‘Neurodiversity’ refers to the variation in cognitive abilities among the human population. It points out the fact that everyone has an unique nervous system with unique abilities and needs (Singer, 2016). As our nervous system is responsible for communication between all parts of the body, a neurological condition has the potential to impair this communication significantly. In case of Multiple Sclerosis, the central nervous system is affected. The myelin sheath surrounding certain nerve fibers suffers degeneration, which causes a delay in or interruption of nerve impulses (Halper & Holland, 2002).

                Registered nurses play a pivotal role in assisting and coordinating the care of patients living with MS (Multiple Sclerosis Nurses Australasia Inc (MSNA), 2016). The correct use of evidence-based research supports and optimises outcomes. Philosophical, theoretical, practical, and regulatory frameworks systematically organise and indicate theories based on relevant concepts in nursing practice (Hammer et al., 2019).

                Due to the degenerative character of MS, it can lead to disabilities over time. The disease has no definitive cure, but pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions can mitigate its progression (Zawada & Campanella, 2022). Caring for patients living with MS involves addressing and identifying psychological, social, and physical issues that might arise from the condition or be aggravated by it.

            <p>Sage is 28 years old and was diagnosed with MS three weeks ago (22 February 2023). Initially, about eight months ago, Sage started experiencing tiredness, muscle weakness and tremors (specially when lifting light weight objects), occasional blurred vision and short-term memory problems. The symptoms occurred infrequently, which caused Sage to not seek help for some time. However, Sage experienced an exacerbation that  resulted in paralysis of her right arm and partial paralysis of her left arm. 
              <p>After relevant assessments to discard other possibilities and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, Sage receives her diagnostic from the medical team and also intravenous treatment (steroids). She was referred to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital for treatment of the paralysis. Upon discharge, Sage was able to hold a glass with her hands but still unable to lift it.</p>
              Sage is still dealing with the fact that she was diagnosed with MS and all the implications of this diagnose to her life. She lives with her mother and sister, who are also affected by the recent events but willing to support her.
              Sage is very confused with all the medical terms she suddenly have to become familiar with, and is unsure about what the next steps are regarding her treatment. She is worried about not being able to lift her arms again, and comes to you for advice.

            Due to the complexity of the disease, MS nursing involves many aspects to consider and 
            reconsider over time depending on patient’s needs, changing conditions, responses and treatment options. 
            The registered nurse will be in a better position to assist S
            age by making use of some underlying principles regarding MS, 
            as discussed by Halper (2012) and summarised on table 1:

            In addition, MS nursing can be organised as domains of practice, 
            which consist of areas of nursing practice where nurses are responsible when assisting a patient with 
            MS and their support network. The domains of practice are also discussed in Burke et al. (2011), Halper (2012), 
            and at the Professional and Practice Standards for Multiple Sclerosis Nurses organised by Multiple Sclerosis Nurses 
            Australasia Inc (MSNA)(2016). 
            They are summarised in Figure 1.

          Often, registered nurses make decisions that reflect their values and beliefs. However, as part of the nursing process and the domains of practice described above, nurses should evaluate whether their moral principles are in line with their duty of care and standard of care set by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA). 
          Among many other possibilities of organisation of moral principles within nursing practice, the four principles of bioethics - non-maleficence, beneficence, respect for autonomy, and justice - are considered a relevant guide to registered nurses (Atkins et al., 2017). Figure X summarises the four principles of bioethics being applied to Sage by a registered nurse.

                <p>Registered Nurses are directly involved in counselling patients and their families about possible treatment options and course of action. This means that nurses are at the forefront of ensuring treatment adherence to patients living with MS by managing or monitoring side effects and discussing treatment outcomes. 
                A study showed that 40% of patients living with MS were non adherent to treatment involving parenteral administration of disease modifying drugs (DMDs) (Treadaway et al., 2009, as cited in Burke et al., 2011), and other studies confirm this finding with 17% to 46% of MS patients not adhering to prescribed treatments (Tremlett & Over, 2003, Portaccio et al., 2008, O’Rourke & Hutchinson, 2005, Rio et al., 2005, as cited in Burke et al., 2011). 
                The scope of treatment options for MS has increased, such as the introduction of oral therapies, which are perceived as being more friendly than parenteral, and therapies with annual dosing schedules (Burke et al., 2011). As a result, patient adherence might increase  even though the changes in treatment also have the potential to pose new challenges to patients and nurses. </p>

              <p>Adherence to treatment is an important part of the management of MS. Some strategies to encourage adherence to treatment and improve long term outcomes are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a therapeutic relationship with the patient and their support network</li>
<li>Effectively involve other members of the health care team in the caring plan of patients </li>
<li>Education: encourage patient’s self-determination and assist them to manage their expectations. A study shows that 57% of patients who decided not to proceed with treatment had misguided expectations (Mohr et al., 1996). </li>
<li>During treatment administration: address patient’s concerns, explain possible side-effects and work on relaxation techniques (Burke et al., 2011).</li>

                <p>The need for highly specialised nurses has increased due to the expansion of treatment options coupled with higher pressure on healthcare systems (Burke et al., 2011). Unfortunately, 31.5% did not have access to MS Nurse care (1 nurse/ 286 patients), and 17.8% were unaware of the existence of an MS Nurse (MS Australia, 2022). This results in deficient care, which contributes to poor health outcomes (faster disease progression, severity of symptoms, depression). </p>

                <p>To optimise the situation, raise the awareness of MS nurses’ value and services provided by them to patients. Increase their access by expanding to Telehealth services and make this available through Medicare, and increase their numbers by secure funding (MS Australia, 2022).</p>
